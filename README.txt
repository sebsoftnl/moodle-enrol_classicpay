SEBSOFT CLASSICPAY ENROLMENT PLUGIN

The Sebsoft ClassicPay enrolment Plugin offers you the possibility to set up paid courses.
It uses a payment gateway to provide payments supporting a wide variety of payment methods.

The service is provided by Sebsoft.
Sebsoft will arrange for your registration at Pay.nl, and we will be able to provide you with the tariffs we're able to supply.
The foundation "Stichting Pay.nl" will collect your funds, and pay out these amounts directly to your account.
This foundation is a so called "third party funds foundation", so in case of any problems at Pay.nl,
the foundation makes sure your money is safe.
Sebsoft will periodically bill you for the transaction costs.
It is only this way we can provide you with this service correct, fast and easy.

You yourself will contractually have an agreement with Pay.nl, where you pay the
transaction cost to Sebsoft, and you will receive the money from "Stichting Pay.nl".
You will receive this contractual agreement from Sebsoft, after validation of all
required legal documents you (must) provide when applying for the service.

COUPONS
The Classicpay plugin provides full support for discount coupons to be created for courses.
A coupon is created either for a specific course or for any accessible course (site wide).
Coupons consist of a startdate and enddate, a percentual discount, the course
it was created for, an optional maximum usage and the coupon code itself.

Once installed, you can manage all coupons from the new administration tree menu.
When you're administrating a course, and the course has the classicpay enrolment
method enabled for the course, the classicpay plugin creates it's own menu item
in the course administration tree.
When you create coupons from there, it's bound to the specific course you're editing.
